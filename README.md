# Teamote
As more and more classes are moving online due to the pandemic, it is very crucial to make sure that students are able to learn properly and teachers are able to teach as they did in classrooms. This web app provides **real time analysis** of the **students’ expressions** and reports the average emotion back to the teacher in order to provide an **accurate representation of understanding and attention**.

## Features
- Teamote contains three major views: a home page, a student's view and a instructor's view.
  - **Home page:** The home page will have two options: student or instructor. Users must input the classroom code into the text box to enter the classroom.
  - **Student's View:** Students will be provided with a special classroom code. They can enter this code into the box and click the button to join the classroom. They must turn on their video in order to participate
  - **Instructor's View:** Upon entering the classroom code, the teacher is taken to the video page. The teacher’s view will display an average percentage of all the student’s emotion data. This will help the instructor recognize if the students are understanding the concepts properly or if a concept should be further clarified.
